Forecast.io in Alfred 2
===============

A Python script to display the current weather conditions from the Forecast.io API in the Alfred window. You will need Alfred 2 and a free Forecast.io API key to use this.

# Installation

To install the Forecast.io Weather workflow, double click on ```Forecast.alfredworkflow``` or drag the workflow to the workflow window in Alfred.

Use the [registration form](https://developer.forecast.io/register) to create a free Forecast.io developer account to get an API key. [Find your latitude and longitude](http://stevemorse.org/jcal/latlon.php), but don’t use more than 4 decimal places.

Next, edit the first script filter by double clicking on it. Edit the line ```print forecast(“APIKEY”, “LAT”, “LONG”))``` to fill in your Forecast.io API key and location. Be sure to keep these in quotes.

# How to use

Simply type ```weather``` (or whatever you configure) into Alfred. If your API access is successful, the current temperature and weather condition should appear followed by a summary of weather in the near future.

If you want more information, hit ```enter``` once the current weather has been displayed. This will open [Forecast.io](http://forecast.io) in Safari.
